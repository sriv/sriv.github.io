      <p>A few days ago, I wrote a <a href='/how-open-source-community-helps-me.html'>post</a> about how open source community help me. I&#8217;ve been thinking about it, and have realized that open source projects are one of my sources of learning what I have learnt.</p>

<p>In this post, I will try to put my thoughts together on what else has helped me.</p>

<p><em>disclaimer</em> - It&#8217;s probably worth mentioning here that I like to keep discovering things I do not know about and spend some time getting familiar with it. Quite a few topics do not maintain my interest level, a handful do. The sources, methods mentioned here are my way of discovering and learning, it may not be for everyone.</p>

<h3 id='at_work'><em>At work</em></h3>

<p><em>Pair Programming</em> - Pairing helps me at various levels. Sometimes, we end up talking about fundamentals of design, and some other times, we debate on what is a good name for a variable. What do I learn by this chit chat? - One more way of doing the same thing - Another example of what won&#8217;t work, before it actually doesn&#8217;t Pair programming isn&#8217;t just two people sitting together in front of a large screen. I have paired with folks who do their homework, and the next morning we share notes. It is twice the reading/research I can do in a night.</p>

<p><em>Community (debates/experiences)</em> - A community is as strong as the interaction. In my organization, the programmer community is very active, on a given day we discuss close to 10 topics actively.</p>

<h3 id='books'><em>Books</em></h3>

<p>This is quite obvious. Right from the school days, books have been a very reliable source of knowledge. However, in school/college, we are fortunate enough to be prescribed a list of books that we should read. In professional world, we are always hunting for a good book on a topic. It becomes a discovery, when we find a book or a chapter that is brilliant.</p>

<p>Stephen Hawking&#8217;s <a href='http://www.hawking.org.uk/a-brief-history-of-time.html'>A brief history of time</a> is one of the books that I answered a very basic question during my school days. Heisenberg&#8217;s Uncertainty Principle is one of popular principles in physics. I had read various textbooks defining what it is. But it was Hawking&#8217;s two and a half page description that actually made sense to me (if you haven&#8217;t already, I would recommend reading chapter 4 of this book.</p>

<p>Now, I wasn&#8217;t reading this book because I wanted to learn Heisenberg&#8217;s principle. In fact, I read this book after I had completed my exams on the topic. And the fact that it made me learn the principle which I knew by heart, gave me that feeling which made me want to jump.</p>

<h3 id='coursera'><em>Coursera</em></h3>

<p>Online courses have taken off in the recent past. And I have been following it as well. What is wonderful about sites like <a href='http://www.coursera.org'>Coursera</a> is that there are a variety of course and most of the courses are concise.</p>

<p>I enrolled into a a few courses. Naturally, one learning from each course is about the course itself. What&#8217;s been serendipitous for me is the perspectives and side learnings. An example, I took the Machine Learning course conducted by Prof. Andrew Ng.</p>

<p>Besides learning machine learning concepts/algorithms, I learnt to use Octave. But my a-ha moment was when Prof. Ng demonstrated how Vectorization can help optimize nested for loops.</p>

<h3 id='internet'><em>Internet</em></h3>

<p>Internet obviously is a wealth of knowledge. A few resources that I cherish/follow</p>
