A few days ago, I wrote a [post](/how-open-source-community-helps-me.html) about how open source community help me. I've been thinking about it, and have realized that open source projects are one of my sources of learning what I have learnt. 

In this post, I will try to put my thoughts together on what else has helped me.

*disclaimer* - It's probably worth mentioning here that I like to keep discovering things I do not know about and spend some time getting familiar with it. Quite a few topics do not maintain my interest level, a handful do. The sources, methods mentioned here are my way of discovering and learning, it may not be for everyone.

###*At work*
  *Pair Programming* - Pairing helps me at various levels. Sometimes, we end up talking about fundamentals of design, and some other times, we debate on what is a good name for a variable. What do I learn by this chit chat? 
  - One more way of doing the same thing
  - Another example of what won't work, before it actually doesn't
  Pair programming isn't just two people sitting together in front of a large screen. I have paired with folks who do their homework, and the next morning we share notes. It is twice the reading/research I can do in a night.
  
  *Community (debates/experiences)* - A community is as strong as the interaction. In my organization, the programmer community is very active, on a given day we discuss close to 10 topics actively. 

###*Books*
This is quite obvious. Right from the school days, books have been a very reliable source of knowledge. However, in school/college, we are fortunate enough to be prescribed a list of books that we should read. In professional world, we are always hunting for a good book on a topic. It becomes a discovery, when we find a book or a chapter that is brilliant.

Stephen Hawking's [A brief history of time](http://www.hawking.org.uk/a-brief-history-of-time.html) is one of the books that I answered a very basic question during my school days. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is one of popular principles in physics. I had read various textbooks defining what it is. But it was Hawking's two and a half page description that actually made sense to me (if you haven't already, I would recommend reading chapter 4 of this book.  

Now, I wasn't reading this book because I wanted to learn Heisenberg's principle. In fact, I read this book after I had completed my exams on the topic. And the fact that it made me learn the principle which I knew by heart, gave me that feeling which made me want to jump.

###*Coursera*
Online courses have taken off in the recent past. And I have been following it as well. What is wonderful about sites like [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) is that there are a variety of course and most of the courses are concise. 

I enrolled into a a few courses. Naturally, one learning from each course is about the course itself. What's been serendipitous for me is the perspectives and side learnings. An example, I took the Machine Learning course conducted by Prof. Andrew Ng. 

Besides learning machine learning concepts/algorithms, I learnt to use Octave. But my a-ha moment was when Prof. Ng demonstrated how Vectorization can help optimize nested for loops. 

###*Internet* 
Internet obviously is a wealth of knowledge. A few resources that I cherish/follow

* Ben Pierce's collection of articles on [Great Works in Programming Languages](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/670Fall04/GreatWorksInPL.shtml)
* [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)
* [Lambda, the ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/)
