My name is Srikanth, I am a programmer/consultant based out of Chennai, India. 

I work for [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) and as part of my work, I get involved with various organizations on a variety of projects. 

However, the impressions and thoughts presented here are mine only, and do not represent those of the organization I work for. 

I have been capturing notes in various forms, and this blog is another medium for me to put my thoughts down. 

More details about me [here](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/srikanth-venugopalan/22/3b9/639).
